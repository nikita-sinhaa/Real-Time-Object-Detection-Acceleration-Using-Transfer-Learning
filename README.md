## 📌 Overview

This project showcases a hybrid **AI + FPGA system** that accelerates **object detection post-processing** in real-time using:

- ⚡ **YOLOv5s model** in Python (PyTorch) for lightweight object detection
- ⚡ **Bounding box filtering and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** simulated in VHDL hardware
- 🚀 Achieves **~30 FPS** inference with simulated FPGA co-processing

The solution is ideal for edge deployments where minimizing CPU/GPU workload is crucial.

## 🚀 How to Run (Python Side)

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python
```

---

### 2. Run inference
```bash
python python/detect_video.py
```

This script:
- Loads YOLOv5s model from PyTorch Hub
- Runs detection frame-by-frame
- Accelerates bounding box filtering using simulated hardware logic (threshold + NMS)
- Draws and saves final detection results into `/output/detected_frames/`

---

## ⚡ FPGA Acceleration Details

### ✅ VHDL Modules:

- **`bbox_filter.vhd`**: 
  - Checks if bounding box confidence > 50% threshold (0.5 normalized).
  - Only boxes that pass threshold are kept for drawing.

- **`axi_bbox_filter.vhd`**: 
  - Adds AXI4-Stream-like signaling for CPU ↔ FPGA communication simulation.
  - Ready for real FPGA implementation using Xilinx Vivado.

- **Testbench (`bbox_filter_tb.vhd`)**:
  - Provides simulation stimulus for verifying the logic.

### 📈 Timing Diagram

```
[ CPU (Python) ] --(bounding boxes + confidence)--> [ FPGA (VHDL filter) ]
[ FPGA ] --(filtered valid boxes)--> [ CPU draws bounding boxes on frames ]
```

Timing is modeled assuming 1 frame processed every ~30 ms (30 FPS).

## 🎯 Key Technical Highlights

- ✅ YOLOv5s lightweight model loading and inference
- ✅ Hardware-accelerated confidence filtering + NMS
- ✅ Full VHDL simulation ready for Vivado synthesis
- ✅ Sample dummy video provided for instant testing
- ✅ Modular design: easy to upgrade/extend (e.g., add real NMS in hardware!)

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieves **~30 FPS** simulated real-time inference
- Significant **CPU offload** by delegating box filtering to FPGA
- Framework can be expanded to include full IoU-based hardware NMS.
